# Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces

In  this  work, we show  that  using  Intelligent  Reflecting  Surfaces  (IRS)
can  enhance  computing  capability  of a  wireless  network  scenario.  We
consider  a  Multiple  Access Channel  (MAC)  where  a  number  of  users  aim
to  send  data  to a  Base  Station  (BS).  The  BS  is  interested  in  decoding
a  linear combination of the data from different users in the corresponding
finite field. By focusing on the Compute-and-Forward framework, we  show  that
by carefully  choosing  the  IRS  parameters,  the computation rate of such
scenario will be greatly improved. Mores pecifically,  we  formulate  an
optimization  problem  to  maximizethe computation rate, and tackle the problem
via an alternating optimization  approach.  Our  results  confirm  the  usefulness
of IRS  technology  for  future  wireless  networks  –such  as  6G–  with
massive  computation  requirements.
